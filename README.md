Created for UVA DS5100 class, Programming for Data Science

For this project, I wrote, tested (unittest), used, packaged, and published a Python module and accompanying files. The main idea of this project was to create a monte carlo simulator. This consisted of created several classes that could be used to create, play, and analyze games of coin tosses and dice. <br>

This repo contains: <br>
 1. A python package for the monte carlo simulator. It contains a Die class, a Game class, an Analyzer class, and a unittest file. <br>
 2. A python notebook demonstrating the package's usage. <br>
 3. Setup and .txt files used for playing the monte carlo simulator. <br>

This project demonstrated understanding of OOP, packaging, data wrangling, and analysis using python.
