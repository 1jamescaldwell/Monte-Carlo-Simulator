# Monte-Carlo-Simulator
A monte carlo simulator using a set of three related classes â€” a Die class, a Game class, and an Analyzer class. <br>

For this project, I wrote, tested (unittest), used, packaged, and published a Python module and accompanying files. <br>

The classes are related in the following way: Game objects are initialized with a Die object, and Analyzer objects are initialized with a Game object.
